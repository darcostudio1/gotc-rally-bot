# GitHub Deployment Instructions

## Step 1: Create a GitHub repository
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Name your repository "gotc-rally-bot"
3. Optional: Add a description
4. Choose whether it should be public or private
5. Don't initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (since we already have those)
6. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect your local repository to GitHub

### Option 1: Using HTTPS (Requires username/password or personal access token)
```
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gotc-rally-bot.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Option 2: Using SSH (Requires SSH key setup but more secure)
```
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/gotc-rally-bot.git
git push -u origin main
```

Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username.

## Step 3: Authentication

### For HTTPS
- If you have 2FA enabled on GitHub, you'll need to use a personal access token instead of password
- Go to GitHub > Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Generate new token
- Select at least the "repo" scope
- Use the token as your password when prompted

### For SSH
- Ensure you have added your SSH key to GitHub
- Go to GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG keys > New SSH key

## Step 4: Verify
After pushing, refresh your GitHub repository page to see your code.
